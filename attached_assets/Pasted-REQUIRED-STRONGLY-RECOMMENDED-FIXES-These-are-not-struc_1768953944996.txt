REQUIRED / STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FIXES

These are not structural — just wording cleanup.

1️⃣ ❌ “We recommend” (MUST CHANGE)
Current
We recommend
HP DeskJet 2855e Wireless All-in-One…

Why this is a risk

“We recommend” can imply:

editorial endorsement

preferential relationship

expert advice

Ads reviewers sometimes flag this when combined with trademarked products.

✅ SAFE REPLACEMENTS (pick ONE)

Best option (neutral):

Featured Product


Also safe:

Popular Choice


Very safe / conservative:

Highlighted Product


👉 Do NOT use: “Editor’s choice”, “Best”, “Top pick”.

2️⃣ ⚠️ Repetitive “Wireless / Wi-Fi” phrasing (OPTIONAL TIGHTENING)

Not a violation, but tightening improves credibility.

Example (optional)

Instead of repeating:

“Wireless, Wi-Fi, and mobile printing options”

Use:

“Wireless and mobile printing support”

✔ Cleaner
✔ Still accurate
✔ Less marketing-heavy

3️⃣ ⚠️ Delivery timing certainty (OPTIONAL SOFTENING)
Current
Orders typically ship within 1–2 business days.
Standard delivery takes 3–7 business days.


This is allowed if accurate, but safest ads wording is:

✅ SAFER VERSION (OPTIONAL)
Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days.
Delivery times vary by destination and carrier and generally range from 3–7 business days.

🟢 WHAT IS ALREADY PERFECT (DO NOT CHANGE)

These are excellent and compliant:

✅ Independent retailer + trademark disclaimers

Clear and repeated properly.
✔ Strong protection with HP Inc.

✅ Product titles & pricing

Exact model names

No “official”, “authorized”, “HP store”

Clear SKUs & prices
✔ Fully compliant.

✅ Warranty wording

“applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered”

✔ This is textbook-perfect.

✅ Shipping wording

“Shipping details are shown at checkout”

✔ Correct
✔ Non-misleading
✔ Consistent across site
