REQUIRED FIXES (DO THESE)
1️⃣ “We recommend” → MUST CHANGE
Current
We recommend
HP OfficeJet 8015e Wireless All-in-One…

Why this is a problem

“We recommend” can be interpreted as:

editorial endorsement

expert advice

preferential promotion of a trademarked product

This wording is commonly flagged during manual ads review.

✅ REQUIRED REPLACEMENT (pick ONE and use consistently)

Best / safest

Featured Product


Also acceptable

Popular Option


❌ Do NOT use: “Editor’s choice”, “Best”, “Top pick”.

2️⃣ Ink trial language (MUST SOFTEN)
Current examples
…with 3 Months of Ink Trial…
…with Ink Trial…

Why this is risky

Ink trial availability can vary by region, seller, or promotion

Ads reviewers may flag this as unverifiable benefit if not guaranteed

✅ SAFE REPLACEMENT

Remove the trial claim from titles and keep the rest intact.

Example

HP OfficeJet 8135e Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer for Office Use


(Do not invent or restate trial terms elsewhere.)

🟡 OPTIONAL (BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED) IMPROVEMENTS

These are not blockers, but they reduce reviewer friction.

3️⃣ “Enterprise-grade security” (optional softening)
Current

“enterprise-grade security”

Safer wording
business security features


This avoids implying certifications or enterprise contracts.

4️⃣ Delivery timing certainty (optional consistency)
Current
Standard delivery takes 3–7 business days

Safer version
Delivery times vary by destination and carrier and typically range from 3–7 business days.

🟢 WHAT IS ALREADY EXCELLENT (DO NOT CHANGE)

These parts are fully compliant:

✔ Independent retailer disclaimer

✔ Trademark notice

✔ Shipping wording (“Shipping details are shown at checkout”)

✔ Warranty wording (“applicable manufacturer standard warranty… where offered”)

✔ Product titles (aside from ink-trial wording)

✔ Prices, SKUs, categories

✔ No “official / authorized / partner” language

✔ No misuse of HP Inc. trademarks
