CURRENT STATUS (IMPORTANT)

This page will FAIL Google & Bing Search Ads review in its current form.

Reason: it reintroduced multiple violations you already removed elsewhere.

🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (MUST FIX)
1️⃣ ❌ “We recommend” (MANDATORY REMOVAL)
Current
We recommend
HP DeskJet 2855e Wireless All-in-One…

Why this fails

Implies editorial endorsement

Implies expertise or preference

Frequently flagged with trademarked products

✅ REQUIRED FIX

Replace everywhere:

We recommend


⬇️

Featured Product


(Use only one neutral label, consistently.)

2️⃣ ❌ “Free shipping on orders over $100” (HARD VIOLATION)
Current
Free shipping on orders over $100.

Why this is critical

You already confirmed: you do NOT offer free shipping

This is misrepresentation

This alone can trigger:

Ad disapproval

Account trust issues

✅ REQUIRED FIX (MANDATORY)

REMOVE this line entirely.

Replace all shipping mentions with:

Shipping details are shown at checkout.


⚠️ Use this wording everywhere on this page.

3️⃣ ❌ “Ink Trial / 3 Months of Ink Trial” (MANDATORY REMOVAL)
Current examples
with 3 Months of Ink Trial
with Ink Trial

Why this fails

Trial availability varies by seller, region, promotion

Ads reviewers treat this as unverifiable promotional benefit

✅ REQUIRED FIX

Remove all trial references from:

Product titles

Descriptions

Example FIX

HP OfficeJet 8135e Wireless All-in-One Color Inkjet Printer for Office Use

4️⃣ ⚠️ Warranty wording inconsistency (MUST STANDARDIZE)
Current (two versions used)

“Products are covered by the manufacturer's standard warranty…”

“Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty…”

Why this matters

Inconsistent warranty language = reviewer friction.

✅ REQUIRED STANDARD WORDING (USE EXACTLY)
Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered; terms vary by product and brand.


Replace all warranty sections with this exact sentence.

🟡 OPTIONAL (BUT STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
5️⃣ Shipping timing certainty (soften)
Current
Standard delivery takes 3–7 business days

Safer version
Delivery times vary by destination and carrier and typically range from 3–7 business days.

🟢 WHAT IS ALREADY GOOD (DO NOT CHANGE)

These parts are clean and compliant:

✔ Product names (minus trial wording)

✔ Prices & SKUs

✔ Category descriptions

✔ Independent retailer disclaimer

✔ HP trademark disclaimer

✔ No “official / authorized / partner” language
