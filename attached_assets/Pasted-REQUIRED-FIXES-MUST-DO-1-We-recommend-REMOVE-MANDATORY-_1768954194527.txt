REQUIRED FIXES (MUST DO)
1️⃣ “We recommend” → REMOVE (MANDATORY)
Current
We recommend
HP ScanJet Pro N4000 snw1 …

Why this is a problem

Implies editorial endorsement

Can be interpreted as expert recommendation

Often flagged with trademarked products

✅ REQUIRED REPLACEMENT

Use one neutral label, consistently:

Best option

Featured Products


(Also acceptable: “Highlighted Products”)

❌ Do NOT use: “Recommended”, “Best”, “Top”, “Editor’s Choice”.

2️⃣ ❌ “Free shipping on orders over $100” (HARD VIOLATION)
Current
Free shipping on orders over $100.

Why this is critical

You already confirmed: no free shipping

This is misrepresentation

One of the fastest ways to get ads disapproved

✅ REQUIRED FIX (MANDATORY)

Remove all free shipping references and replace every shipping mention with:

Shipping details are shown at checkout.


Use this wording only.

3️⃣ ❌ Warranty wording inconsistency (MUST STANDARDIZE)
Current

“Products are covered by the manufacturer's standard warranty…”

Required site-wide wording (USE EXACTLY)
Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered; terms vary by product and brand.


Consistency matters for ads reviewers.

🟡 OPTIONAL (BUT RECOMMENDED)
4️⃣ Delivery time certainty (optional softening)
Current
Standard delivery takes 3–7 business days

Safer wording
Delivery times vary by destination and carrier and typically range from 3–7 business days.

🟢 WHAT IS ALREADY EXCELLENT (DO NOT CHANGE)

These parts are fully compliant:

✔ Product titles & prices

✔ Correct scanner categorization

✔ No “official / authorized / partner” language

✔ Independent retailer disclaimer

✔ HP trademark disclaimer

✔ Neutral, educational category copy

🛠️ TASKS TO GIVE REPLIT (CLEAR LIST)

Replace “We recommend” with “Featured Products”

Remove all “Free shipping” mentions

Standardize shipping text to:

“Shipping details are shown at checkout.”

Replace warranty section with the approved standard sentence

Do NOT change product titles, prices, SKUs, layout, or disclaimers
