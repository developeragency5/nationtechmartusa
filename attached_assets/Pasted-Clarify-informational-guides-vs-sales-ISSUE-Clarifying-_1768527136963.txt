Clarify informational guides vs sales
────────────────────────

ISSUE:
Clarifying that buying guides are informational (not sales claims) strengthens your non-affiliate, educational positioning.

ADD THIS SINGLE SENTENCE
(MUST MATCH EXACTLY):

“Educational guides and informational content provided on the Site are for general informational purposes only and are separate from product sales.”

PLACEMENT:
- Add as a standalone sentence in:
  - Section 1 (Introduction), OR
  - Section 4 (Use of the Site / Content), whichever fits best
- Do NOT repeat the sentence in multiple sections.

RULES:
- Use plain body text.
- Do NOT bold or highlight.
- Do NOT reference affiliates, commissions, or endorsements.

────────────────────────
ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- Eligibility section now uses age + capacity wording only.
- Informational-content sentence appears once.
- No other Terms content is modified.

GOAL:
- Cleaner legal eligibility standard
- Stronger separation between education and commerce
- Reduced misinterpretation risk
TASK: Remove all “USA-based” / physical-presence wording and replace with safe service-based language.

CRITICAL ISSUE:
Phrases like “USA-based business” imply headquarters, physical operations, or manufacturer presence. This creates misrepresentation risk and can trigger Google Ads or manual reviews.

TEXT TO REMOVE COMPLETELY (EVERYWHERE):
- “USA-based”
- “U.S.-based”
- “U.S. company”
- “American business”
- “Headquartered in the USA”
- Any wording implying physical headquarters or domestic operations

APPROVED SAFE REPLACEMENT
(USE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING EXACTLY, DEPENDING ON CONTEXT):

Option A (short, neutral):
“Serving customers in the United States.”

Option B (identity / about / footer use):
“An independent online retailer serving customers across the United States.”

SCOPE (GLOBAL):
- Homepage
- About page
- Footer
- Policies (Privacy, Terms, Returns, Shipping)
- FAQs
- Marketing copy or trust badges
- Metadata or page descriptions (if visible)

REPLACEMENT RULES:
- Replace wording, NOT layout.
- Do NOT add new sentences or qualifiers.
- Choose ONE approved option per section and keep it consistent within that section.

STRICTLY DO NOT USE:
- USA-based
- U.S.-based
- American-owned
- Headquartered
- Offices / warehouses / locations
- Any language implying domestic manufacturing or operations

ACCEPTANCE CHECK:
- No “USA-based” or similar phrasing exists anywhere on the site.
- Approved replacement language appears cleanly where needed.
- No physical presence or origin claims remain.

GOAL:
- Eliminate location-based misrepresentation risk
- Align with Google Ads & payment processor expectations
- Maintain consistent, defensible identity language
