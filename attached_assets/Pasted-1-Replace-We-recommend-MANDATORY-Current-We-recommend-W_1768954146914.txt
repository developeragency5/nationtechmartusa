1️⃣ Replace “We recommend” (MANDATORY)
Current

We recommend

Why

Can be seen as endorsement / editorial recommendation with trademarked products.

Fix (use one neutral label everywhere)

Replace with:

Featured Products
or
Highlighted Products

2️⃣ Remove the non-laser product from Laser category (MANDATORY)
Current (first item)

HP Smart Tank 651 Wireless All-in-One Ink Tank Printer…

That is NOT a laser printer (it’s an ink tank/inkjet-type line). This isn’t an ads-policy violation, but it hurts trust and can create misleading categorization issues if users click ads expecting “laser printers”.

Fix

Move HP Smart Tank 651 to Inkjet / Ink Tank / Home Printers category page

Keep Laser page strictly laser models

🟡 OPTIONAL IMPROVEMENTS (RECOMMENDED)
3️⃣ Shipping wording consistency (optional)

On other pages you’ve standardized to “shipping details shown at checkout”. Here you use:

“Orders typically ship within 1–2 business days…”

That’s fine if true, but best to match sitewide wording.

Safer replacement:

“Orders are typically processed within 1–2 business days. Delivery times vary by destination and carrier and generally range from 3–7 business days.”

4️⃣ Warranty sentence consistency (optional)

You currently say:

“Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered. Warranty terms vary…”

Your standard “best” wording is one line:

“Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered; terms vary by product and brand.”

Use the same everywhere.

5️⃣ Fix the SKU typo (strongly recommended)

This line looks wrong:

SKU HP LaserJet M209 High-Speed Monochrome Laser Printer for Office Use

Should be like your other SKUs (PRN-...). Not an ads violation, but it looks unprofessional and can cause checkout/support issues.

✅ TASKS TO GIVE REPLIT (COPY/PASTE)

Replace “We recommend” with “Featured Products” (or “Highlighted Products”) everywhere on this page

Remove/move HP Smart Tank 651 from Laser Printers page to the appropriate Inkjet/Ink Tank/Home category

(Optional) Standardize shipping paragraph to “processed” + “delivery varies” language

(Optional) Standardize warranty to one consistent sentence across site

(Recommended) Fix the SKU format for HP LaserJet M209 to match the PRN- pattern
