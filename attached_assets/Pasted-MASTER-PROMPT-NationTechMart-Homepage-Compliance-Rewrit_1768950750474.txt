MASTER PROMPT — NationTechMart Homepage Compliance Rewrite (U.S. Search Ads Safe)

I will paste my current NationTechMart homepage text below. Your task is to rewrite ONLY the text content to make it fully compliant for U.S. Google Search Ads and Microsoft/Bing Ads, and safe for HP trademark use as an independent online retailer.

DO NOT change:
- Layout / section order
- Navigation labels
- Button labels (unless they contain compliance issues)
- Product model names in Featured Products (keep “HP DeskJet 2827e”, etc.)
- Category names (Home Printers, Office Printers, Inkjet Printers, Laser Printers, Document Scanners)

STRICT COMPLIANCE RULES:
1) No affiliation claims:
   - We are NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, sponsored by, partnered with, authorized by, or certified by HP or any manufacturer.
   - Do NOT use words like: “official”, “authorized”, “certified”, “partner”, “approved”, “exclusive”, “preferred”, “direct from manufacturer”.

2) Shipping truth:
   - We DO NOT offer free shipping.
   - Remove ALL mentions of “Free Shipping”, “Free shipping over $100”, “free delivery”, or anything implying free shipping.
   - Replace with: “Shipping costs are calculated at checkout based on address and order details.”

3) Warranty truth:
   - Do NOT say “manufacturer warranties on all products”.
   - Use conditional language:
     “Products include applicable manufacturer standard warranty coverage where offered; terms vary by product and brand.”

4) Avoid endorsement-style wording:
   - Replace “curated selection” with “wide selection”.
   - Avoid language that implies special access or endorsement.

5) Replace “guides” claim (we do NOT provide guides):
   - Remove/replace “Professional Guides” and any “comprehensive guides/resources” claims.
   - Replace with a truthful benefit:
     “Clear Product Information: We provide detailed specifications and compatibility details on product pages so you can choose confidently.”

6) Trust Bar update:
   - Replace the Trust Bar items to be truthful and compliant.
   - Use these 3 items exactly:
     - “Shipping Calculated at Checkout”
     - “Secure Checkout - SSL encrypted”
     - “Easy Returns - 30-day return policy (eligibility applies)”
   (If your rewrite mentions returns, include “eligibility/exclusions apply” somewhere to avoid absolute claims.)

7) Add trademark notice (homepage bottom, near footer area):
   Add this exact line:
   “Trademark Notice: All product names, logos, and brands are property of their respective owners. No affiliation or endorsement is implied.”

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Return the updated homepage copy in the SAME section-by-section format I provided:
  HERO CAROUSEL (Slide 1/2), Trust Bar, About, Find the Right Printer cards, Featured Products, Shop by Category, Why NationTechMart, Our Commitment, Our Approach, Who We Serve, Transparency & Policies, FAQ, Newsletter.
- Keep the tone: professional, neutral, factual, non-deceptive, e-commerce appropriate.
- Avoid exaggerated claims (no “best”, “#1”, “guaranteed lowest price”, etc.) unless provable.
